Hi Dr. Inge! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. How are you today?

Keywords? Phrases to avoid?

As a person with a Master's degree, should I look for a data science internship or go right for entry to mid-level positions?

How important are professional certifications, especially for someone who is switching fields?

What advice would you recommend to someone trying to break into a tech field? (data science specifically)

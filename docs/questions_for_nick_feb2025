How can you tell if a model is overfitted?
    logitPS2 ~ Treatment + AmbientLight + (1 | Device)

gsw and phi2 models

Do scaled residuals *need* to be scaled around zero?

What's the best way to assess if a model is accurate?

everything except for treatment should be a random effect because I don't care about them, correct?

when using random effects, if the random effect (RE) is continuous, should I get a random slope for each treatment (RE|Treatment)? or is there a better way to do it?

##
try log transforming y variable

split factor into Treatment and Germination boolean

cross validation
    split dataset into folds (10x folding validation)
    fit model to folds 1-9, test model on 10th fold (root means square error)
        repeat for each set of 9 folds
    end up with 10 rmse values, average them out

    compare to a null model
        fit null model to same 10 folds
        use the MEAN of the data as the predicted value
    use t test to compare RMSEs

    RMSEnull - RMSEfitted / RMSEnull

easier to just use Rsquared and pseudoRsquared

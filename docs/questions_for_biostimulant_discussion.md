### Questions for me


If we lose summer, we're nine months behind where we could be. Incentivize the GRA to give us more money, faster.

Look for faster growing crops. Look for phase II match. Federal USDA grants, STTR, SBIR, NIFA. Georgia grown. Specialty crop block grant.   

American farm buearu. Grow NY. 

Come up with 100k from outside GRA and they'll match it.

Present it to them in business methodologies. *speak their language*


### Next steps

Gantt chart

Look for sources of external funding.

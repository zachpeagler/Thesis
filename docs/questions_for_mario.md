## Budget

Bead creation, bacterial culturing, consumables, etc.

## Disappearing water container
The DI water container has disappeared from the lab. Do you know what has happened to it? It's possible it belonged to Dr. Sutton and the school reappropriated it after she left.

## Tomato Data
### Missing 2021 data

Only 4 readings for plant D7.

The D row has significantly lower FvP/FmP.

>Why were plants A3, A4, A7, D1, and D7 removed from the fruit data?

According to the 2021 fruit data, plant C7 belongs to the Salt+Inoc group, while according to the expected experimental design it should be in the inoculation only group. Do you recall anything about this?

> **spider mites!**

### Writeups for 2021 and 2022
 - Germination date
    - 2021: Transplanted April 30, 2021. September 28, 2021.
    - 2022: Transplanted on March 31, 2022. Germinated in early March. (we lost our initial seedlings)
      - Torn down December 14th
 - Inoculant load (concentration)
   - 2021:
   - 2022: 3.24 - 2.6 x 10^8 CFU/mL
 - Inoculant timing
   - 2021: 
   - 2022: 20 mL every week for the first five weeks
 

 > Why did you switch from randomly assigning treatments in 2021 to applying treatments in rows in 2022?

## Spectrophotometer
### Appropriating SC 350's spectrophotometer
Former professor Clint Penick used some of his startup funds to purchase a spectrophotometer, which is now languishing unused in SC 350. It is perfect for our microbial assays and can handle 96 well plates capable of being scheduled and patterned and rectangular cuvettes for instant reads. 
I'm already familiar with the software and lab protocols for this specific device as I used it while performing ant antimicrobial trials with Dr. Penick.

### Alternate spectrophotometers
> Are there other spectrophotometers available to us, ideally within SC or SL?

## Combination chitosan and alginate.
Apparently you can just soak beads in alginate then soak them in CaCl2. [Pitaktamrong2018](references/pitaktamrong2018.pdf)

## Documentation for MET and VDC

working on it

### Pictures!
### Does a thesis contain budget and timeline sections, or is that only the proposal?
### How many graphs is appropriate in a thesis?

## 2/29/2025
Meeting with Nick on Tuesday, Feb 25 to talk about analysis.

no real updates. working on thesis. it's slow going. reframing it to talk more about alginate rather than purely chitosan.
